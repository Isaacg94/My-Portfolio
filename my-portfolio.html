        <p>This was my debut to the World Wide Web! A simple class project that i undertook at Moringa School that required me to basically create my first webpage using basic HTML, style it with CSS, create a repository on GitHub, commit regularly as well as push to the remote repository on GitHub.</p>

        <p>In this project I was required to create a website for an animal shelter. I featured the animals available for adoption on the home page. I then used divs and floats to give each animal its own profile section, them I changed the styles of the elements on the page using cascading.</p>
